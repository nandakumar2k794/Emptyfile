SIH26057 — Slant-to-Ground Range Correction
============================================

Raw side-scan sonar data is collected in SLANT RANGE — the direct line-of-sight
distance from the towfish transducer to the seabed. This produces two artifacts:

  1. NADIR BLIND ZONE: The first returns come from directly below the towfish
     (the "water column"). This zone contains no useful seabed data and must
     be removed.

  2. GEOMETRIC DISTORTION: Objects at the same horizontal distance but different
     depths appear at different positions in the raw sonar image. Close-range
     returns are compressed, far-range returns are stretched.

The correction uses the Pythagorean theorem assuming a flat seabed:

    R_ground = sqrt(R_slant² − H_towfish²)

Where:
    R_slant    = Direct distance from transducer to seabed point (meters)
    H_towfish  = Altitude of towfish above the seabed (meters)
    R_ground   = True horizontal distance across the seabed (meters)

IMPORTANT: This formula is valid ONLY for R_slant ≥ H_towfish.
For R_slant < H_towfish, the return is from the WATER COLUMN (no seabed echo),
and these samples are discarded — this is the nadir removal step.
